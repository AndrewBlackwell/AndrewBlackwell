**Computer Science & Mathematics @ Appalachian State University**  

I presently work on systems, performance, and infrastructure mostly in C++. I'm interested in concurrency, distributed systems, and making things fast and reliable. Generally, I enjoy applying pattern recognition and optimization across different domains.  

Outside of class, I’ve competed in [memory sports](https://mindsportsolympiad.com/), [poker tournaments](https://www.thehendonmob.com/), and [competitive programming](https://open.kattis.com/users/blackwellaf).
